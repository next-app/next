Stay informed!

This is very much a work-in-progress, and it should not be relied upon until
it is stable. Once stable, this README will be updated accordingly.

If you want to clone this repository to your local computer and start contributing,
you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have `git`, `node`, and `npm` installed on your computer.
2. From the command line, `cd` into an **empty** directory that you want to become your local repo.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/next-app/next.git .` to clone all the files into this directory.
4. Run `npm install` to download all of the Node dependencies.
5. That's it! You can now navigate to `<local repo>/public/index.html` in a browser and see the pages.
6. When you make changes to the Omelet code, you'll need to run `npm run build` to re-build the HTML and the templates. When you make changes to the CSS or non-template JavaScript, you don't need to do this.
